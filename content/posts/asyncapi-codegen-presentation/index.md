![AsyncAPI and Gopher](./asyncapi-and-gopher.png)

This first blog post is about an open-source tool that I'm currently writing
[here](https://github.com/lerenn/asyncapi-codegen).

## AsyncAPI, an initiative to rule them all

### What is AsyncAPI?

As a response to the lack of clearly defined contracts between asynchronous
services, Fran MÃ©ndez started the project AsyncAPI as a set of tools heavily
inspired by OpenAPI initiative to define communication inside an Event-Driven
Architecture (EDA).

Like OpenAPI, you have a specification, in YAML or JSON, that can be used to
define the interfaces of asynchronous APIs. It can use any type of protocols and
brokers (NATS, Kafka, RabbitMQ, gRPC, etc) but also any format (JSON, Protobuf, etc).

*The dream of the AsyncAPI creator*

After years of development, it grew, became an important project and joined the
Linux Foundation Projects with the goal to be industry standard for defining
asynchronous APIs.

### An AsyncAPI specification example

Here is what it can look like, from the [official documentation](https://www.asyncapi.com/):

```yaml
asyncapi: 2.6.0
info:
  title: Account Service
  version: 1.0.0
  description: This service is in charge of user signups
channels:
  user/signedup:
    subscribe:
      message:
        $ref: '#/components/messages/UserSignedUp'
components:
  messages:
    UserSignedUp:
      payload:
        type: object
        properties:
          displayName:
            type: string
            description: Name of the user
          email:
            type: string
            format: email
            description: Email of the user
```

Some elements may look familiar to you, like the components defining schemas or the
information part, as they are directly inspired from OpenAPI specifications.

Some are quite different: the first level `channels`
defines the channel that the user of the API can publish or subscribe to. You
can also find some `messages` definition in the `components` that describe
the messages that can be sent and/or received on the different channels.

You can then read this document as a possibility to subscribe to user signing up
events on the channel `user/signedup` where messages contains the `name` and `email`
of the user.

Messages payload can be displayed in JSON format:

```json
{
    "displayName": "Louis",
    "email": "louis@example.com"
}
```

If you are curious of the numerous possiblities, you can read the
[official reference](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference).

## The code, the spec and the maintainability

Of course, It can be really cumbersome to maintain the source code associated to
the specification. That's why there is two ways of doing that:
* Generate the specification from the code
* Generate the code from the specification

You can already see where we are going, as this post is about code generation!

### An official tool for code generation... but with Javascript and NPM

For that, the project provides a [Javascript tool](https://github.com/asyncapi/generator)
to generate source code from specification in numerous languages: Python, Java,
Markdown, PHP, ... and even Go! All you have to do is install the corresponding
NPM packages and launch the right command tool.


![NPM and JS with Go](./heavy-npm-js.jpg)
*NPM and JS being like books: useful but heavy*

However, despite the great advantages of the Javascript ecosystem, a lot of
developers (including myself) are a bit reluctant to install NPM packages with
the really heavy stack that it implies. Especially for Go project where a specific
command exist to run Go programs (and other tools) directly from the official
Go command: `go generate`.

To use it, we only have to add some preprocessing instructions at the top of
some files:

```golang
//go:generate <insert here the shell command>

package mypkg
```

We could use directly the official tool with `go generate` but it would require
to have the Javascript tools installed and to download the NPM packages.

Ideally, we would need something in Go to run the `go run` command inside the
`go generate` preprocessing command. It would be the most portable way to generate
the code, as you would just have to have the Go stack installed. One language, one stack!

### The inspiration: a really popular Go tool, but for OpenAPI

During daytime, and especially work time, I used a great tool to generate code
from OpenAPI specification: [deepmap/oapi-codegen](https://github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen).

This tool takes an openapi specification and generate all the code needed to
make any major Go HTTP server (Gin, Echo, Chi, etc) with the given specification.

On top of that, you can use the `//go:generate` preprocessing annotation to
automatically generate the source code.

```go
//go:generate go run github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen/cmd/oapi-codegen@latest -package mypkg openapi.yaml > openapi.gen.go

package mypkg
```

At the time, I craved for this tool on AsyncAPI, and as it was not existant, I
decided to wrote it. And a few month later (and few PR also), `asyncapi-codegen`
was available!

## AsyncAPI-Codegen, hands on user signup

### Code architecture

This schema describe how the code generated by AsyncAPI Codegen will interact
between existing application, user and broker:

![Code architecture](./with-codegen-schema.svg)

Here are the different part of the code that will be autogenerated:

* <span style="color:#d79b00">Provided (or custom) code for broker</span>: you
  can use one of the provided broker (NATS, Kafka), or provide you own by satisfying
  BrokerController interface.
* <span style="color:#ffda74">Generated code</span>: code generated
  by `asyncapi-codegen`.
* <span style="color:#b85450">Calling the generated code</span>: you
  need to write a few lines of code to call the generated code from your own code.
* <span style="color:#6c8ebf">App/User code</span>: this is the code of your existing
  application and/or user. As it is conform to AsyncAPI spec, you can use it
  on only one of the two side against the app/user on another language.

### Installing AsyncAPI-Codegen

Well let's take the example we had in the first part of this post, let's save
it in a `asyncapi.yaml` and generate the corresponding code for a NATS broker.

First, we should install the tool:

```shell
# Install the tool
go install github.com/lerenn/asyncapi-codegen/cmd/asyncapi-codegen@latest
```

Then create the new golang project with the following lines:

```shell
# Create a new directory for the project and enter
mkdir $GOPATH/src/asyncapi-example
cd $GOPATH/src/asyncapi-example

# Create the go module files
go mod init

# Create the asyncapi yaml into the repository
touch asyncapi.yaml
# Then edit it to add the YAML content provided earlier
```

Then we can generate the code:

```shell
# Generate the code from the asyncapi file
# One for the application, one for the user and one for the common types
asyncapi-codegen -i ./asyncapi.yaml -p main -g application -o ./app.gen.go
asyncapi-codegen -i ./asyncapi.yaml -p main -g types -o ./types.gen.go
asyncapi-codegen -i ./asyncapi.yaml -p main -g user -o ./user.gen.go

# Install dependencies needed by the generated code
go get -u github.com/lerenn/asyncapi-codegen/pkg/extensions
```

### Deep dive into the generated code

#### Application generated code

Let's analyse what is present in `app.gen.go`:

```golang
// AppController is the structure that provides publishing capabilities to the
// developer and and connect the broker with the App.
type AppController struct

// NewAppController links the App to the broker.
func NewAppController(/* ... */) (*AppController, error)

// Close will clean up any existing resources on the controller.
func (c *AppController) Close(/* ... */)

// PublishUserSignedup will publish messages to 'user/signedup' channel.
func (c *AppController) PublishUserSignedup(/* ... */) error
```

We can see that we can create a new `AppController` based on a broker controller,
that will allow us to publish `UsersSignedUp` messages on the corresponding channel.

#### User generated code

Let's analyse what is present in `user.gen.go`:

```golang
// UserSubscriber represents all handlers that are expecting messages.
type UserSubscriber interface

// UserController is the structure that provides publishing capabilities
// to the developer and and connect the broker with the User.
type UserController struct

// NewUserController links the User to the broker.
func NewUserController(/* ... */) (*UserController, error)

// Close will clean up any existing resources on the controller.
func (c *UserController) Close(ctx context.Context)

// SubscribeAll will subscribe to channels without parameters on which
// the app is expecting messages.
func (c *UserController) SubscribeAll(/* ... */) error

// UnsubscribeAll will unsubscribe all remaining subscribed channels.
func (c *UserController) UnsubscribeAll(/* ... */)

// SubscribeUserSignedup will subscribe to new messages
// from 'user/signedup' channel.
func (c *UserController) SubscribeUserSignedup(/* ... */) error

// UnsubscribeUserSignedup will unsubscribe messages from
// 'user/signedup' channel.
func (c *UserController) UnsubscribeUserSignedup(/* ... */)
```

Like the application controller, we can see that we can create a new
`UserController` based on a broker controller. It will allow us to subscribe
ti `UsersSignedUp` messages on the corresponding channel, and even to all
subscribable channels present in the specification (here, only one: `user/signedup`).

### Use the generated code
